# DataSquad-Database-1

In this project we created  a bookstore database with 15 tables. The bookstore.sql consist of sql query that creates 15 tables , queries.sql consist of queries to be added to tables.
Together, these files help build and interact with the bookstore database for demonstration or testing.
The visualization.html file is a  HTML document we created to display database tables using an embedded diagram viewer. 
It visually represents the structure and relationships between tables, including keys and connections.
